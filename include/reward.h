// Design a class Reward which can take one of four possible values from 1 to 4 rubies. 
// A reward must also be printable with the insertion operator cout << reward.

// An object of type Reward can not be copied or assigned and needs a private constructor 
// but will give RewardDeck (see below) friend access.
